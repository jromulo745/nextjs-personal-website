    "0": "Objective 1.1 concentrates on Windows 10 editions, feature differences, and upgrade paths.",
    "1": "Windows 10 editions RAM limits: Home = 128 GB, Pro = 2 TB, Pro for Workstations/ Enterprise = 6 TB.",
    "2": "Note: Regardless of what edition you run, it’s important to make sure that your system has the resources required to run Windows. For example, on a 64-bit system, the Windows 10 minimum requirements include 1 GHz CPU, 2 GB of RAM, and 20 GB of free storage space (32 GB for virtual machines).",
    "3": "Be able to identify Windows 10’s icons, Start button, Start menu, taskbar, search tool, pinned applications, and notification area.",
    "4": "Objective 1.2 focuses on navigational commands such as cd, dir, md, and rmdir; as well as command-line tools such as chkdsk, sfc, format, and robocopy.",
    "5": "Note: In Windows 11, right-clicking on the Start button shows Terminal instead of Command Prompt by default.",
    "6": "Know how to open PowerShell from the Search tool, from the Start menu, and from the Run prompt.",
    "7": "Note: Administrators who write scripts often are likely to use Visual Studio Code (known as VSC or VSCode). This is an integrated development environment (IDE) that can be used to build PowerShell scripts and scripts in other programming languages (such as Python). It has a built-in command line as well—often defaulting to PowerShell— that you can use to test your scripts. It’s free and open source as of the writing of this book. Also, it’s cross-platform—meaning you can run it on other systems as well, such as Linux. I highly suggest checking it out: https://code.visualstudio.com.",
    "8": "Note: As a reminder, directory is the original name for folder. The more accurate names are directory when working in any command line and folder when working in the GUI, but the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.",
    "9": "note: The older versions of md and rd are mkdir and rmdir, respectively.",
    "10": "Know how to use the cd, cd .., and cd \\ commands in PowerShell or the Command Prompt.",
    "11": "Note: You can create a file such as test.txt within Notepad, which is available via the Search tool or by going to Run and typing notepad. Notepad is the default graphical text editor in Windows, and you can use it for editing text files and scripts. However, you might opt to use another editor, especially if you plan on doing any scripting or coding. (Some alternatives include Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, and my favorite—though it is not graphical—Vim.)",
    "12": "Understand how to use dir, copy, xcopy, and robocopy for the exam.",
    "13": "Note: %systemroot% is the folder where Windows was installed; by default, it is C:\\Windows.",

    "15": "To view additional IP configuration information, such as DNS servers and MAC addresses, use the ipconfig /all command.",
    "16": "Note: The ipconfig command (and most other commands, for that matter) can also be run from the Search tool or the Run prompt. Just open one of these tools and type cmd /k ipconfig to open up a shell and display the results of the command.",
    "17": "Note: Another way to flush the DNS cache is to issue the command netsh int ip in PowerShell. But beware: This completely resets the TCP/IP connection for the network adapter.",
    "18": "Note: Latency is the time it takes for sent data packets to be received by a remote computer. Latency increases with distance, type of network connection used, and network congestion. For example, a ping to a computer on the LAN should have very low latency—perhaps less than 1 millisecond (ms). But a ping initiated from a computer in New York City to a computer in Los Angeles over a cable Internet connection might have a latency of 25 ms. This can be a very enlightening piece of the ping results.",
    "19": "Note: You can also use the ping loopback and ping localhost commands, adding -4 for IPv4 and -6 for IPv6. However, for testing, pinging the IP address is usually recommended.",

    "26": "Note: Work with the Task Manager on your system and get to know the program. You will be using it often.",
    "27": "Note: You will learn quickly that administrative functions should be carried out only by users who have administrative privileges. Even if you have administrative privileges, a pop-up User Account Control (UAC) window appears every time you try to access tools such as the MMC. Simply click Yes or Continue to open the program. Users who don’t have administrative capabilities will either be blocked altogether or won’t be able to continue when the UAC window pops up.",
    "28": "Note: The extension .msc is used for a Microsoft Management console snap-in control file, also known as a Microsoft console window. As mentioned, this and many of the other tools we’ll discuss in this chapter can be added to the MMC as snap-ins. I recommend that you add them to your MMC so that you can get to them easily while you are studying.",
    "29": "Be able to describe the Event Viewer’s System, Application, and Security log files as well as the information, warning, error, and audit success events.",
    "30": "Know how to access the properties of a device, install drivers, and enable/disable devices in the Device Manager.",
    "31": "Note: Other tools that can be used to track resource usage include the Resource Monitor (Run > resmon.exe) and the Performance tab of the Task Manager, though these are not as thorough as Performance Monitor, nor do they have the ability to save the tracked resource usage.",
    "32": "Note: If you want to add the Group Policy Editor to your MMC, go to File > Add/Remove Snap-in, and then click Group Policy Object Editor and click Add. For the Group Policy Object, you will see Local Computer. Leave that as is and click Finish.",

    "34": "This portion of Objective 1.3 concentrates on Disk Management and additional tools (such as Resource Monitor, System Configuration, and Regedit).",
    "35": "Note: WARNING: ALL DATA WILL BE ERASED during the format procedure.",
    "36": "There is, technically, a difference between a partition and a volume. A partition is a logical division of a drive. A volume is any space among one or more drives that receives a drive letter.",
    "37": "Know how to access the Optimize Drives/Disk Defragmenter utility in Windows and know the defrag command in the Command Prompt.",
    "38": "Be able to open MSConfig and identify what each of the tabs is used for.",

    "48": "Know how to run and troubleshoot Windows Update.",
    "49": "Know where and how to modify display resolution and scaling in Settings.",
    "50": "Note: Color depth is different from color space. This refers to the number of colors that the Windows desktop uses. In the old days, you could have 8-bit color, 16-bit color, and other options. However, in Windows 10/11, the default option is 32-bit, which means 4,294,967,296 colors. Because of this, you might have difficulty displaying older programs properly. With older programs, you can use the Program Compatibility tool (discussed in Chapter 35) to run the programs at a lower color depth. You might also accomplish this within the Advanced Display settings or by using a virtual machine.",
    "51": "Know the tabs of the System Properties dialog box.",
