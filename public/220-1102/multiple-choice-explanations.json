Authenticator apps are used to verify a user to a system and are often used in place of the second step of two-factor authentication, but they are not as secure as using a certificate.

The format E: command will only format the drive to a new file system; that is not secure enough if the data has to be removed altogether. Clearing is the removal of data from a drive that is to be repurposed and used again within the organization. The diskpart utility can be used to clear the drive, but it is not appropriate for drive disposal.",

Degaussing a hard disk drive will render the data unreadable and, in most cases, will make the drive unusable. By default, the diskpart and dd processes listed will only zero out the drive once. They would have to be run with an additional parameter or run manually two more times to meet the criteria. Also, dd is run from Linux, not from Windows, so that is another reason that answer is incorrect. But be very careful: Note that the drive listed in the dd command is sda1. That will most likely be the system drive; if the command is run on that drive, the OS will be erased, which is what you want in this case. Just remember to use caution when erasing drives. Double-check what you are doing before you run any commands.",

The rest of the answers are not examples of sanitizing or purging. Clearing the drive by formatting or zeroing out does not meet the requirements for sending the drive out to another company as standardized by NIST and the DoD. Degaussing the drive will render it useless. Pulverizing the drive (shredding it) will destroy it and will also render it unusable.",
  "87": "By enabling content filtering (and parental controls), you can select computers—by MAC address—and select what websites (domains) those computers are allowed to connect to. MAC filtering by itself simply allows or denies computers access to the router based on the MAC address of the computer. Disabling unused ports is a good idea, but it will simply stop a computer from accessing the SOHO router if it is connected on that port. Port forwarding involves configuring a router to forward Internet-based IP addresses and ports to a computer or server that is on the LAN or the screened subnet. Power levels refer to the broadcasting power of an AP’s radio. The lower, the better—as long as people on the perimeter of the building can still communicate with the router.",

It follows that USB is set first in the BIOS boot order, and therefore the system could not boot to the main storage drive that houses the OS. While this could also be fixed by simply disconnecting the USB drive, the BIOS boot order should be changed immediately as having USB first is a security issue. Generally, end users should not be rebooting PCs (and you might even have a policy enforcing this); however, the user had already restarted the system. (By the way, end users usually should not update their systems, either.) Opening the computer and checking cables should be further down the troubleshooting list because these steps take time (and are most likely not the issue here). Uninstalling, reinstalling, and updating all applications could take an enormous amount of time and has very little to do with the problem. If removing the USB flash drive and modifying the BIOS boot order doesn’t fix the problem, a hardware diagnostics check might be necessary.",

Never purchase new equipment until you have exhausted all other ideas!",

The technician might also be tempted to check the physical integrity of the disk with the chkdsk command, but this is different from checking protected Windows system files. Rolling back updates might be necessary but could cause more issues than it solves. Plus, the idea here is to check the system files first without actually doing anything. Restarting all services would seem to be a bit extreme for this scenario, but it could be done in MSConfig > Services or with the PowerShell Restart-Service cmdlet. However, it would probably be wiser to focus on a few select services first instead of restarting all of them. Windows profiles are separate from the protected system files; the technician should rebuild these files if he suspects that there are problems with user accounts.",

Then consider proposing written policies, security controls, and training programs to prevent the issue from happening again. “Schedule scans and run updates” is step 5. “Enable System Restore and create a restore point” is step 6. “Documenting findings, actions, and outcomes” is a great idea!

The device should be taken offline, quarantined, and isolated immediately. The real issue is that the user downloaded a malicious application from an untrusted source. This application then took control of the system. A jailbreak occurs on iOS-based devices. We know that this is an Android-based device because the application downloaded was an Android package (APK). The user might have been fooled into thinking that the application was legitimate, but this isn’t something that happened to the device per se. Developer mode is used to take control of certain aspects of a mobile device, such as to enable USB debugging mode. While developer mode can be used maliciously, it is more likely that the primary issue here is that the phone was rooted.",

However, the trouble ticket system might not be easily searchable. The knowledge base, on the other hand, is designed for anyone to easily search by issue or by solution. There is no need to escalate the problem as it’s been solved! Emailing the rest of the technicians is not necessary; if everyone did this for every problem, the whole team would be swimming in email! Besides, that would defeat the purpose of the knowledge base—to store concise solutions to problems for easy reference later on.",

Incident documentation is used during the incident response process. Compliance policy deals with adhering to guidelines, standards, and possibly law.

This document needs to be approached from a business standpoint and written in a way that your team, and management, can read easily. It will hopefully include many things, such as the purpose of the change, the scope of the change, a rollback plan (or backout plan), systems affected, and so on. As you see, by using the process of elimination, you reject the other potential answers in the question; remember this technique. It’s awesome that you are using a Linux server to run web services—perhaps Apache web server or NGINX—and as a technician, you have the know-how to make the upgrade work. However, your proposal needs to “sell” the idea to the organization. The change request document needs to show that the process will not disrupt business operations (at least not too much) and that the organization’s risk will be reduced as much as possible. It needs to show that everything is planned out step-by-step and that you have a contingency plan (backout plan) if something goes awry.
