  "What is layer 1 of the OSI Model?": "Physical",
  "The ________ layer of the OSI model identifies the network’s physical characteristics, including the following specifications": "physical",
  "The ____ ____ layer is responsible for getting data to the physical layer so that it can transmit over the network.": "data link",
  "The term _____ describes the logical grouping of data at the data link layer.": "frame",
  "The data link layer has two distinct sublayers: the ___ layer & the LLC layer.": "MAC",

  "The term ______ describes the logical grouping of data at the network layer.": "packet",
  "The basic function of the transport layer is to provide mechanisms to transport data between network devices.": "transport",
  "Protocols that operate at th_________ layer can either be connectionless, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP), or connection oriented, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).": "transport",
  "The ____________ layer’s basic function is to convert the data intended for or received from the application layer into another format.": "presentation",
  "Another important function of the ____________ layer is encryption, which is the scrambling of data so that it can’t be read by anyone other than the intended recipient. Given the basic role of the ____________ layer—that of data-format translator—it is the obvious place for encryption and decryption to take place.": "presentation",
  "In simple terms, the function of the ___________ layer is to take requests and data from the users and pass them to the lower layers of the OSI model.
