  "2": "It could be that the laptop is now on battery power and is set to a dimmer display and shorter sleep configuration while on battery. The laptop may not be getting AC power from the AC outlet for some reason. The battery power setting is the first thing you should check; afterward, start troubleshooting the AC adapter, cable, AC outlet, and so on. It’s too early to try replacing the display; try not to replace something until you have ruled out all other possibilities. A dim screen is not caused by OS corruption. There’s no need to plug in an external monitor; you know the video adapter is working, it’s just dim.",
  "3": "The DC jack was probably damaged when the laptop was dropped. It may have been plugged in (charging) and fallen on the plug that connects to the DC jack (which is easily damaged on many laptops). The customer probably used the laptop until the battery became discharged before noticing that the laptop wouldn’t take a charge anymore—and now it won’t turn on at all. So the battery is probably not the issue. A power adapter can be damaged, but the DC-in jack is more easily damaged. The storage drive and the BIOS/UEFI normally will not affect whether the laptop will turn on.",

Incorporating biometrics means implementing a thumbprint scan or other physical characteristic scan into the authentication process. Disabling NFC means that near-field communications will be turned off, and data can’t be “beamed” to other devices. Enabling MFA means that you are implementing multi-factor authentication—for example, combining a password and biometrics. \n\nWhile none of the incorrect answers can reduce the risk of a laptop being stolen, they do decrease the chance of data being stolen. As you can guess, computer security can be incredibly deep.",
  "5": "Turning on airplane mode (the most likely cause of the problem) will disable wireless transmissions, including NFC. This is great for security purposes, but it can also disable the ability to connect to Wi-Fi networks or send/receive calls. A failed power state would render the entire device unusable; however, the question says the user was able to boot and sign on to the device. Biometric authentication is most likely not the cause of the problem in this scenario because the user is not having problems signing on to the device. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can occur when two objects with different voltages come into contact with each other. ESD can wreak havoc with electronic components, but it is not the most likely problem here because the device appears to be working normally in all other regards—plus it’s somewhat uncommon for mobile devices. The real issue here is user error: The user did not remember that the device was in airplane mode. When you troubleshoot problems, remember that they are often user related!",

Moving the wireless access point is a potential solution but would require a bit of hands-on work because the WAP is mounted to the ceiling. Reconfiguring the WAP to use 2.4 GHz doesn’t ensure a reduction in interference; you would still need to do a wireless site survey to make sure there is no channel overlap, which is actually more likely with 2.4 GHz than with 5 GHz.

  "75": "To perform drive encryption, some motherboards come with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a chip that stores encryption keys and can be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI. Intel Virtualization Technology (VT) is part of the firmware that supports the use of virtualization software such as Hyper-V and VMware. Secure Boot can block rootkits and other malware from launching boot loaders that have been tampered with. Firmware (such as a motherboard’s BIOS/UEFI) should be updated, or “flashed,” periodically to take advantage of the latest functionality and security updates.",
  "76": "Configure USB permissions to prevent USB drop attacks. In a USB drop attack, a malicious person leaves a USB drive lying around somewhere, in the hopes that someone will pick it up and plug it into their computer. The USB drive contains a virus or other malicious payload and subsequently infects the computer. By disabling USB altogether in the BIOS/UEFI, you can avoid these types of attacks. A boot password is a good idea also, so no one can modify your settings—once you have made them that is; you still have to configure USB securely first. The BIOS Time/Date settings allow you to modify the date and time for the system but won’t prevent USB drives from being used and therefore won’t prevent USB drop attacks. Storage area network (SAN) settings doesn’t have any relationship to USB devices.",
  "77": "Power LED, Power switch, and storage drive LED case connectors plug into headers on the motherboard. The actual SATA drive connects to the motherboard’s SATA port with a 7-pin data connector. PCIe slots are used for video, audio, and network cards (among other things). The main 24-pin power connection from the power supply connects to the 24-pin ATX port. Know your connections!",
  "78": "Multithreading allows for an operating system to send two simultaneous threads to be processed by a single CPU core. The OS views the CPU core as two virtual processors. Multiple cores would imply multicore technology, which means there are two physical processing cores within the CPU package. HyperTransport is a high-speed connection used by AMD from the CPU to RAM.",
  "79": "Thermal paste is used to seal the small gaps between the CPU and the heat sink. It is sometimes referred to as thermal gel or jelly (among a variety of other names), but not grape jelly. (Did I ever tell you about the time I found grape jelly inside a customer’s computer? Fun times.) Note: Never use petroleum-based products (such as 3-in-1 oil or WD-40) inside a computer; the oils can damage the components over time.",
  "80": "TDP (thermal design power) is the amount of power required to cool a computer and is linked directly to the amount of heat a CPU creates. Some CPUs come with a built-in graphics processing unit (GPU). This means that with a compatible motherboard, no separate video card is necessary. PSU stands for power supply unit. 140 watts is a potential TDP rating but does not define what TDP is.",
  "81": "The CPU needs to be compatible with the socket of the motherboard. The case doesn’t actually make much of a difference when it comes to the CPU. (Just make sure it’s large enough!) There is no wattage range, but you should be concerned with the voltage range of the CPU. PCI Express (PCIe) slots don’t actually play into this at all because there is no direct connectivity between the two.",
  "82": "LGA (Land Grid Array) is the type of socket that uses “lands” to connect the socket to the CPU. PGA (Pin Grid Array) sockets have pinholes that make for connectivity to the CPU’s copper pins. AM4 is a PGA socket that accepts AMD CPUs such as the Ryzen 7.",
  "83": "Overclocking enables the user to increase the clock speed of the CPU within the BIOS. Level 3 (L3) cache comes in the largest capacities of the three types of cache and has the most latency; therefore, it is the slowest. If the CPU can’t find what it needs in L1, it moves to L2 and then to L3. An integrated GPU is a video adapter that is built into the motherboard. The heat sink helps to dissipate heat from the CPU and is usually aided by a fan or liquid cooling system.",
  "84": "You would want an x86-64 CPU. This 64-bit CPU architecture can go beyond the 32-bit limitation of 4 GB of RAM and access as much as 256 TB of RAM (theoretically). Also, that is normally the type of CPU you would use in a PC. ARM-based CPUs are more often used with smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. Reduced instruction set computing (RISC) is a highly optimized technology used in ARM CPUs to make them more efficient. x86 is the older 32-bit version of PC-based CPUs. It is unlikely that you will see an x86 CPU, but you never know!",
  "85": "Some computers (such as servers) have multiple sockets, allowing them to run more than one CPU at the same time. Each of these physical CPUs will also incorporate multi-core and multithreading technologies. Get ready for 64 simultaneous threads or more! This is the kind of stuff that makes the cloud work.",
  "86": "15-pin connectors power SATA storage drives and other SATA devices (such as optical drives). That said, you might see a Molex power port on a modular PSU that can ultimately be connected to a SATA drive (with a Molex-to-SATA cable), but not directly; the SATA drive will have a 15-pin power connection on it. Molex connectors are also typically used for power fans, older IDE devices, and other secondary devices. 6-pin power connectors are used for video cards (as are 8-pin connectors). 24-pin refers to the main power connection for the motherboard.",
  "87": "Molex connectors provide 12 volts and 5 volts. There are four wires: if color-coded, yellow is 12 V, red is 5 V, and the two black wires are grounds.",
  "88": "Most likely, the voltage selector was set to 230 V so that it could function properly in Europe (for example, in the UK). It needs to be changed to 115 V so that the power supply can work properly in the United States. Make sure to do this while the computer is off and unplugged. Note: For shorter trips, a person will most likely use a laptop, which would require the right adapter to convert the voltage properly.",
  "89": "The Network and Sharing Center in Windows is where printer sharing is enabled. Network Connections is the window that shows the Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections that a system has to the network. Windows sharing has to be done in Windows; it can’t be done from the printer’s operator control panel (OCP). Bonjour is a macOS service that enables automatic discovery of devices on the LAN; it can also be run on Windows.",
  "90": "Duplexing (as it relates to printers) means printing on both sides of the paper. Collating means printing multiple copies of a document’s pages in sequence instead of printing all of the copies of one page at a time. Orientation refers to how the print job is displayed on the paper; it could be portrait (vertical orientation—the default) or landscape (horizontal orientation). Quality refers to the clarity of the print job and is usually measured in dots per inch (DPI), where the higher the DPI setting, the better the quality.",
  "91": "Know the difference between printer driver types: PostScript (less common, used for professional graphics and presentations) and PCL (more common, used for typical office printing). ADF, which stands for automatic document feeder, refers to a wonderful contraption that allows you to scan, copy, or fax multiple page documents without having to feed each page individually. SMB, which stands for Server Message Block, is a network file sharing protocol.",

  "96": "The 3D printing process (or additive manufacturing process) requires that you use resin (plastic filament) or a similar consumable. This plastic is what the 3D structures are made of. Toner is used by laser printers. Ink is used by inkjet printers. Thermal paper is used by thermal printers. And a ribbon is used by an impact printer.",
  "97": "Software as a service (SaaS) is the most commonly recognized cloud service; it allows users to use applications to access data that is stored by a third party on the Internet. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a service that offers computer networking, storage, load balancing, routing, and VM hosting. Platform as a service (PaaS) is used for easy-to-configure operating systems and on-demand computing. A community cloud is a mix of public and private clouds, but one where multiple organizations can share the public portion.",
  "98": "The best option listed is a private cloud. This gives the most control over data and resources in an environment where there are limited users (and a healthy budget). These resources could be entirely internal, or a portion of them could also be provided by a third party. Public cloud technology is used for the general public to access applications over the Internet. Hybrid is a mixture of public and private, but it is not necessary in this situation because of the healthy budget and the limited number of users. Community cloud is similar to hybrid but is meant for multiple organizations that share data, which is not necessary in this scenario.",
  "99": "Rapid elasticity is the ability to build a cloud-based network or extend an existing one quickly and efficiently. Measured services refers to a provider monitoring a customer’s service usage in order to properly bill the customer. Metered utilization (or metered services) refers to a customer being able to access as many resources as needed and be billed only for what was accessed. On-demand service means that the cloud service is available at all times. Also, it allows a user to store data to the cloud when necessary but remove that data from the cloud when space is freed up at the local system. The leaders of a successful organization don’t care what it takes; they simply want high-speed, secure access to services 24/7.",
  "100": "With a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), multiple virtual desktops for multiple users are hosted by a service. High availability (HA) for any on-demand service means that the cloud should be available in real time and whenever needed. Shared resources are resources such as CPU, RAM, and drive storage resources that multiple customers use on a server in a cloud environment. File synchronization means that files that are stored in multiple different locations are kept up to date through the use of cloud services. The incorrect answers are important when planning and implementing a cloud-based service, but VDI can be hosted in the cloud or on-premises.",
  "101": "You would need to run virtualization software that includes a type 2 hypervisor such as Windows 10/11 Hyper-V, VMware Workstation, or VirtualBox. Type 1 hypervisors are used on servers; they are also known as bare metal because they allow virtual machines to access the computer hardware directly. With cross-platform virtualization, an organization uses multiple virtualization programs, such as VirtualBox and Hyper-V.",
  "102": "The biggest risk of running a virtual computer is that it will go offline immediately if the server that it is housed on fails. All other virtual computers on that particular server will also go offline immediately.",
  "103": "VMware uses the .vmdk file extension for the virtual hard drive file. VirtualBox uses .vdi by default (although it can use others). Hyper-V uses .vhdx. VT-x is the Intel virtualization extension that is incorporated into Intel-based systems and must be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI for virtualization software to work.",
  "104": "Network address translation (NAT)–based network connections are the most common default. NAT allows the VMs to have their own IP network but still connect to the external network and make use of the Internet. This is the same principle behind NAT used in a SOHO network. Bridged means that the VMs have access to the external network, but they must use IP addresses from that external network. Private means that multiple VMs within a host can communicate with each other but not beyond the host. The no networking option disables any type of networking connectivity for the VM in question.",
  "105": "The developer should run the custom application in a sandbox. A sandbox is designed to run code in an isolated way. It could possibly be done in a virtual machine, but the virtual machine is not secure by default; a container would usually be a better option. NAT stands for Network Address Translation, and while the sandbox could be located in a NAT network, that in itself is not enough. In addition, the developer might not want any network connectivity for the custom application. VirtualBox is a type of virtualization software. Again, the developer might choose VirtualBox as the tool to run a VM, but it has to be done in a secure way. A properly isolated sandbox would have to be set up within a VM on VirtualBox (which itself should be secured properly as well).",
  "106": "The second step is to establish a theory of probable cause. You need to look for the obvious or most probable cause of the problem. If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms.",

  "112": "This one is a little tricky. Always consider corporate policies, procedures, and impacts before implementing changes! This is, in essence, “step zero,” as it is listed before steps 1 through 6 in the official CompTIA A+ 220-1101 objectives. As such, it should always be on your mind, regardless of where in the troubleshooting process you are, especially if the solution will affect multiple users.\n\nIn this scenario, the technician has already established a plan of action (step 4). The rest of the answers are things that should have already happened: “Refer to the vendor’s instructions for guidance” is part of step 4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution. “Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes” is part of step 1, and so is “perform backups before making changes.” While these are all important, you must always consider policies, procedures, and impacts first as well as during each step of the troubleshooting methodology.",
  "113": "Although there might be a Windows application that monitors the battery, the surefire way is to test the voltage of the lithium battery with a multimeter. A CR2032 lithium battery is designed to run at 3 volts (and they often ship at approximately 3.3 volts). Some UEFI/BIOS programs can also monitor the voltage of the battery.",
  "114": "You should replace the motherboard if it is damaged. It would be much too time-consuming to even attempt replacing the capacitors and probably not cost-effective.",
  "115": "You should check the BIOS version and consult the documentation that accompanies the motherboard. You might need to go online for this information. You can also try performing a POST analysis to discern the problem. The issue could be video based, or RAM based, but the beep code should help identify the problem.",
  "116": "Check connections first as they are a common culprit.",
  "117": "If the CPU is running beyond the recommended voltage range for extended periods of time, it can be a sign of a failing CPU. If the computer won’t boot at all, another problem might have occurred, or the CPU might have already failed. Low case temperatures are a good thing (as long as they aren’t below freezing). Spyware is unrelated in this case.",
  "118": "Because the computer is being used in a warehouse (and a warehouse is often a fairly dirty environment), you should use compressed air on the RAM slot and clean the memory module with contact cleaner. Clean out all of the dust bunnies within the entire computer. Using MemTest86 or another memory diagnostic tool is another good answer.",
  "119": "The best thing to do in this situation is to install heat sinks on the RAM modules. On older computers, the memory controller in a northbridge doesn’t usually overheat because it already has a heat sink; on newer computers, it is within the CPU. A CPU can have only one fan. You can’t install more (although an additional case fan might help). The chipset also usually has a heat sink.",
  "120": "If you are sure that the RAM is compatible and the system doesn’t recognize it during POST, try flashing the UEFI/BIOS. It could be that the RAM is so new that the motherboard doesn’t have the required firmware to identify the new RAM.",
  "121": "You should test the computer with a PSU tester. This can tell you whether the power supply functions properly. You already know that the AC outlet is functional, so there is no reason to use another outlet. The computer would still turn on if the RAM wasn’t seated properly. A UPS won’t help the situation because it is part of the power flow before the power supply.",
  "122": "Attempt to defragment the disk. If defragmentation is not necessary, Windows lets you know. Then you can move to other options, such as scanning the drive for viruses.",
  "123": "Most likely, the SATA port is faulty. It might have been damaged during the upgrade. To test the theory, you would plug the SATA data cable into another port on the motherboard. You can’t format the drive until it has been recognized by the BIOS, which, by the way, should recognize SATA drives if the motherboard has SATA ports! SATA drives don’t use jumpers unless they need to coexist with older IDE drives. Most of today’s drives do not come with jumpers.",
  "124": "If you test a SATA power cable, you should find 3.3 V (orange wire), 5 V (red wire), and 12 V (yellow wire). If any of these doesn’t test properly, try another SATA power connector.",
  "125": "When the BIOS was updated, the SATA setting in the BIOS probably reverted to AHCI. That caused the RAID 0 array to be ignored, and so the OS would not boot because it is stored on that array. The setting should be changed from AHCI to RAID (or similar name). Now, if this was a RAID 1 mirror, a copy of the OS would be on each drive, and it might still boot (though you would probably receive a message about the state of the mirror being degraded or broken). But with RAID 0, the OS is striped across two or more drives; all drives need to be present and accessed via RAID in order for the OS to boot. That’s one of the reasons the golden rule for many years was to “mirror the OS and stripe the data.” Phew! Anyway, on to the incorrect answers. RAID 1 is incorrect because there would be no option to set this; this scenario uses RAID 0. S.M.A.R.T. is the monitoring system included in HDDs and SSDs. NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is the specification for non-volatile storage used by M.2 drives, PCIe card–based drives, and so on. Remember to back up any and all BIOS configurations!",
  "126": "Don’t hesitate! Copy the data to another drive. Afterward, update the UEFI/BIOS, replace the drive with a new one, and consider getting a new SATA cable while you are at it.",
  "127": "Boot into a low-resolution mode. In Windows, this is called Enable Low-Resolution Video. Safe Mode is another valid option, but keep in mind that Safe Mode loads Windows with a minimal set of drivers, and you can’t access the Internet. Depending on the display configuration, pressing the monitor toggle key might actually fix the problem temporarily by displaying the screen on a secondary monitor, but it doesn’t solve the root cause of the problem.",
  "128": "You should use DxDiag to troubleshoot video issues. The other three answers are not used to troubleshoot video. Regedit is used to perform advanced configurations in the registry. Msconfig is used to change how the system boots and to enable/disable services. The Task Manager is used to see the performance of the computer and view applications and processes that are running. We’ll discuss the rest of those tools in more depth in the Windows portion of this book.",
  "129": "Try installing a video card first to see if the system will still work. Unless it is a specialized system, the video card should be less expensive than the motherboard. (In addition, it will take a lot less time to install.) PC techs usually do not replace connectors, and this step should be further down your troubleshooting list. An adapter cannot help if the DVI port is broken.",
  "130": "If the driver installation doesn’t complete, you should roll back the driver. It could be that you have attempted to install the incorrect driver. After you roll back the faulty installation, find the correct latest version of the video driver from the manufacturer’s website. Installing the driver again will most likely have the same result. Only reinstall the original video card temporarily if you cannot find a proper solution right away.",
  "131": "Check the connectivity of the video cable. If it is flickering, chances are that the cable is loose, or the cable’s quality is lacking. Screen flicker is more common with older VGA cables, but it can happen with just about any connection, depending on the age and quality of the cable. Remember, always check the basic stuff first: connectivity, power, and so on. It is unlikely that the projector settings will make a difference in this particular case. You cannot change the aspect ratio by itself on most laptops; however, when you change the resolution (which was already done, according to the question), you might be changing the aspect ratio as well, depending on the resolution selected. A loose or damaged power cable would probably result in more than just screen flicker; the projector might power off and power back on, which would prevent the image from being displayed for at least several seconds while the projector powers back up.",
  "132": "Check the brightness slider first! Chances are that the brightness is turned all the way down, and in a bright environment, it might appear that nothing is on the screen. Or the device might simply need to be woken up, so use the side button or the home button or double-tap the screen to wake up the device. If these measures are not successful, restart the device. Screen calibration has nothing to do with brightness, but on some rare mobile devices, it might be necessary. The volume sliders are not part of the problem. Don’t open the device until you have exhausted every other known option—and do so only if you are qualified to work on this type of device; otherwise, send it to an authorized repair center.",
  "133": "Stay away from magnetically charged tools such as screwdrivers and bits. These can potentially damage circuitry and components. All of the other answers are valid procedures—things you should do when working on mobile devices, and computers in general.",
  "134": "You should upgrade the RAM on the printer. Large graphics files need a lot of memory (in both on the PC and the printer). But if the PC can send the file to the printer, it has enough RAM and storage drive space. Printer drivers will not cause an “out of memory” error to display on the printer.",
  "135": "Turn off the printer before you start working inside it. You want to make sure it is off and unplugged before you put your hands inside it. Taking it offline is not enough in this case.",
  "136": "Impact printer maintenance procedures include replacing the ribbon, replacing the print head, and replacing paper. Laser printer maintenance includes replacing toner, applying a maintenance kit, calibrating, and cleaning. Thermal printer maintenance includes replacing paper, cleaning the heating element, and removing debris. Inkjet printer maintenance includes cleaning the heads, replacing cartridges, calibrating, and clearing jams.",
  "137": "The Start printing immediately option is faster than the Start printing after last page is spooled option when spooling documents. The Print directly to the printer option doesn’t use the spooling feature. There is no option called Start printing after the separator page.",
  "138": "Check the super-obvious first: Make sure the computer has a physical cabled connection to the network. Then attempt things such as ipconfig, ping, and network driver updates.",
  "139": "This is the concept of pinging outward. Start by pinging the localhost, then a computer, and then the router on the network. Then ping a domain name or website. If you can ping a website but the browser cannot get through, the browser might have been compromised. If you cannot ping the website, you should check the IP configuration; the DNS server address might be incorrectly configured. You should update the OS and AV software right away if you suspect that the browser has been compromised.",
  "140": "Some routers and switches can disable physical ports (which is a smart security measure). Check that first. Later, you can check whether the network adapter is compatible with the OS and update it if necessary. Do not replace the cable with a crossover cable; this type of cable is used to connect one computer to another.",
  "141": "It is most likely port flapping (aka link flapping), which involves a communications link alternating between on and off states, back and forth. Jitter is an irregular time delay for particular packets (such as VoIP packets). It can be caused by network congestion, which simply means there is too much traffic on the network! High latency means data packets take longer to travel between a client computer and another system, and it occurs all the time.",
  "142": "Run netstat -a to see which types of connections the local computer has to the Internet currently. Advise the user to close any unnecessary programs and limit the number of streams of data. The tracert command in Windows is used to determine the route or path taken to a destination. The ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew commands release and renew the DHCP-obtained IP address on a Windows system.",
  "143": "The first thing to check is the distance of the computer from the WAP. Also consider the wireless channel being used and check for external interference. An APIPA address is a self-assigned IP address in Windows (for example, 169.254.49.26). Configuring quality of service (QoS) on a router prioritizes the packets that are more important to the users. Outdated equipment is a potential culprit; perhaps the organization needs a new WAP. However, “outdated cables” is not correct because this is a wireless scenario!"
